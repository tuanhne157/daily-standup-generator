## Reflection

This tool saves me 10–15 minutes every morning by automating the preparation of daily standup reports.
Instead of switching between GitHub, Git CLI, and Trello and writing updates manually,
now I just run node index.js, and it generates the entire report in seconds.

It’s a small but practical improvement that eliminates repetitive tasks and helps me stay focused and productive each day.

# Daily Standup Generator 📝

Automatically generate your daily standup reports from Git commits and GitHub issues.
✅ Working prototype: Node.js app that fetches Git commits and GitHub issues, then generates a formatted daily standup report.
